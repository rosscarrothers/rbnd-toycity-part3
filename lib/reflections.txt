How long did you spend working on this project?
- About an hour.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
- Learning how to call a class function from an instance function as well as getting the inject function working properly

What two additional features did you build? Why?
  1. New public method for Customers: purchases. Outputs the name of every item purchased by the customer. Useful for customers to review their order history.
  2. New public method for Customers: total_spent. Returns the total amount of money this customer has spent. Useful for customers to track their budget.

Where do you still have room to grow?
- More familiarity with Ruby functions. I still need to reference documentation for pretty basic things like adding to arrays or what the correct syntax is for 
looping over an array etc. Should come with more practice.
